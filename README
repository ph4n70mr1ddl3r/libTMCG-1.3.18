# LibTMCG poker demo (trimmed)

This repository is a cleaned‑up subset of LibTMCG 1.3.18 focused on building
and running the non‑interactive mental poker example `t-poker-noninteractive`.

What’s included
---------------
- Full `src/` library sources needed by the demo.
- A single test/demo program in `tests/t-poker-noninteractive.cc` plus helpers.
- CMake build system.

What’s removed
--------------
- All other tests, examples, and documentation from upstream.
- All build artifacts (`.o`, `.libs`, `.deps`, generated Makefiles, etc.).

Requirements
------------
You need a C++ compiler and the following libraries and headers installed:
- GMP (`libgmp` >= 4.2)
- libgcrypt (`libgcrypt` >= 1.6)
- libgpg-error (`libgpg-error` >= 1.12)
- Botan 2.x is optional (enable with CMake option `-DWITH_BOTAN=ON`).

Build
-----
From a fresh clone:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

This builds the static library and the `t-poker-noninteractive` executable.

Run
---
Run
---
After building:

```bash
./build/t-poker-noninteractive
```

Notes
-----
- Forking support is enabled by default. To build a “no-forking” binary:
  `cmake -S . -B build -DENABLE_FORKING=OFF`
- Upstream LibTMCG is GPL‑2.0; see `COPYING`.
